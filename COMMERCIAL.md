# GitSecure Commercial License

## Why Commercial License?

If you're using GitSecure in a commercial/proprietary setting, you need a commercial license because:

- **GPL v3 is copyleft** - Requires you to open source your entire codebase
- **Corporate legal compliance** - Many companies cannot use GPL software
- **Proprietary integration** - Cannot integrate GPL code into closed-source products
- **Commercial redistribution** - Cannot sell products containing GPL code

## What's Included

Commercial license includes:

✅ **Use in proprietary software**  
✅ **No open source requirements**  
✅ **Premium features** (coming soon):
   - Team dashboard
   - Slack/Teams integration

   - SSO integration
   - Priority support

✅ **Support & Updates**
